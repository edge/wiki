# Node one

Node One was the second dedicated device that we designed alongside industrial design agency, Blond. Node One was designed to be upgradable, which made it significantly more powerful than the Founding Node.

Node One embraced the limitations and restrictions inherent in computing devices. The device needed to be working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with unrestricted efficiency. The design is unapologetic, with a simple aesthetic. Designed to look good anywhere in the home or office, almost every surface was vented for maximum efficiency and to allow other items to be stored nearby, without prohibiting ventilation.

Node One wasn't put in to full production. It was held back, pending the completion of several core components in the network, neccessary to get the most out of its power footprint.
