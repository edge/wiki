# Founding Node

The Founding Node was a limited edition device designed around the Raspberry Pi in collaboration with industrial design agency, Blond. The Founding Node was the result of five months of prototyping and development, culminating in a unique glass and silicone structure with an exposed circuit board. It looks great in any home or office setting.

The Raspberry Pi demonstrated the power of the network software, and the ease with which the platform could grow through the use of the low and high powered devices all around us.

Hundreds of Founding Nodes were given away to early community supporters, with devices shipped to 96 countries worldwide. There are around 300 still in operation today.
