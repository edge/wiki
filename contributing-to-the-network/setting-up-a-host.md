# Setting up a Host

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Host onboarding is temporarily suspended. It's expected to open again in the coming months**
{% endhint %}

Onboarding is now open for Host nodes on the Edge network, with support for Linux based AMD64/ARM devices.

You can access our Apt repository here: [archive.edge.network](https://archive.edge.network/)

## Minimum Specifications

Our base recommendation is a device with the equivalent capacity of a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, with a 64GB SD.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Devices with higher performance/capacity will return a higher yield**
{% endhint %}

## Installation Process

The process has been designed to be as straightforward as possible.

The process is as follows:

1. Install Docker \(vs. 18.06+\)
2. Install Edge Cli \(`edge-cli`\)
3. Connect your device to your console.edge.network account
4. Provide your refundable proof of stake \(the wallet address will be provided by a member of the team\)
5. Await enabling for production traffic in the network

### Installing Cli

#### Add the Edge Repository to Your Sources

```bash
$ echo "deb https://archive.edge.network/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edge.list
```

#### Import the Public Key for the Repository

```bash
$ wget -q -O - https://archive.edge.network/KEY.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

#### Update Apt

```bash
$ sudo apt update
```

#### Install Edge Cli

```bash
$ sudo apt install edge-cli
```

Once done, you'll need to add you device your account at console.edge.network, which is done at the command line through Cli, as shown in the following steps.

#### Attach Your Device to Your Account

```bash
$ edge-cli login -u "email@address.com"
```

#### Register your Device

```bash
$ edge-cli register
```

#### Start the Node

```bash
$ edge-cli start
```

Note that `edge-cli start` will return a message if your device hasnâ€™t been funded.

{% hint style="info" %}
**You only need to run`edge-cli start`once. Edge self-restarts, including on reboot**
