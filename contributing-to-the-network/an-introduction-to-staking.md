# An Introduction to Staking

If you have spare computational power, you can earn income by becoming an Edge Host.

Edge nodes earn $XE coins in return for this, which can be used to purchase services from the network, or exchanged for $EDGE to trade in the wider crypto marketplace.

Stakes also form an important part of the tokenomics of the platform. They lock value in the network and reduce overall circulating supply.

At the moment, the software for running an Edge node is only available for Linux. However, we're making versions available for Windows, OSX and mobile devices too.

To add a node to the network, you have to provide a stake in $XE via your account in the [Edge Console](https://console.edge.network).

## Proof of Stake

Proof of Stake \(POS\) in the Edge network is designed to incentivise system stability and security while ensuring a high level of decentralisation.

Staking levels are set based on the capacity requirements in the network in any given period. As the Edge Network is a marketplace, it is important to ensure that node contributions match customer demand, and that these requirements remain balanced.

In the event that a Node does not meet minimum availability targets, penalties will be applied against their POS. You can think of this as an uptime guarantee. Uptime is more important for Stargates than for Gateways, and more important for Gateways than for Hosts, so availability requirements are set accordingly. Stargates must meet a 99.9999% availability, whereas for Hosts availability is set at 20%. Availability can be low for Hosts because of how the system is architected: it's designed to allow for a high level of disconnect and reconnect at this level.

As the requirements for Nodes grows, the proof of stake required at each level in the network will be reduced. This metric is a balance of supply, demand and network availability.

## Stake amounts

| Node Type | $XE Stake Required | Expected Yield \(Av.\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Stargate | 250,000 | 20% |
| Gateway | 25,000 | 15% |
| Host | 2,500 | 10% |
