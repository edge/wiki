# Open Positions

## Full Stack Developer

We're looking for a talented full-stack developer with experience building full web stacks to join our core team and help us build a greener future for the Internet.

The ideal candidate will be fluent in building web sites and apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including Vue.js) on the frontend, as well building APIs and services with Node.js on the backend.

Attention to detail is critical, and you should be able to apply a high level of finish to the products you work on, both in terms of user-facing interfaces as well as behind-the-scenes services.

At Edge, we're fully remote, forever. We're looking for someone who's highly motivated and a self-starter, with good communication skills and experience working within a remote team setting.

### Required Experience

* Frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vue.js)
* Backend development using JavaScript & TypeScript (Node.js)
* Source code management using git & GitHub

### Desirable Experience

* Container technologies such as Docker
* Continuous integration & delivery practices
* Full stack systems development, from frontends to API through to data stores
* Cryptography including asymmetric (priv/pub keys), symmetric, hashing, etc.
* Blockchain & cryptocurrency experience, such as Web3, Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.

If you don’t have experience in the above, we still want you to get in touch with us. We’re looking for someone who's motivated and able to learn, and we provide the opportunities to do that while working on super interesting projects.
