# Wallets

## $EDGE

{% hint style="success" %}
**$EDGE was listed on Uniswap on the 09th of September, 2021**
{% endhint %}

Any Ethereum or multicoin wallet that supports custom ERC-20 tokens can be used to send and receive your $EDGE tokens. Keep in mind that in order to move the token on the Ethereum network, you will need ETH in your wallet to pay for network transaction fees (commonly known as "gas").

We recommend using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [enkrypt](https://www.enkrypt.com) or the [XE Mobile Wallet](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xe/id1563680145), but these are by no means your only option.

Things to look for when choosing a wallet are:

1. Native support for your tokens and/or the ability to add Custom Tokens
2. The ability to interact with contracts (dApps) on the Ethereum network
3. Hardware wallet support (if desired)

## $XE

### Web Wallet

{% hint style="success" %}
**The XE web wallet is available now**
{% endhint %}

$XE has its own network native client-side wallet. This is a JavaScript app that runs entirely in your local browser. The web wallet provides the ability to generate and restore $XE wallets, view your transaction history, make transactions within the $XE network, bridge between $XE and $EDGE and stake $XE against network nodes.

You can access the XE web wallet at: [wallet.xe.network](https://wallet.xe.network)

### Mobile Wallet

{% hint style="danger" %}
**The XE mobile wallet isn't currently available**
{% endhint %}

XE has it's own mobile wallet. It's available for iOS and includes support for $EDGE and $ETH, facilitating the bridging to and from $XE directly in app.

Future versions of the app will allow you to buy and sell $XE directly in the app using the network's exchange function. You will also be able to stake XE and Eth, and in time enable your device directly as a network node.
