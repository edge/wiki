# Explorer

{% hint style="success" %}
**You can access the explorer at:** [**xe.network**](https://xe.network)****
{% endhint %}

As its own blockchain, $XE also has its own explorer. This is powered by an API at the heart of the blockchain that securely exposes endpoints for blocks, transactions and wallets.

You can use the explorer to explore blocks and transactions. We'll be adding wallet exploration and a deeper level of analytics soon.

In addition, when device staking moves to the contract layer in XE, we'll be folding the Edge Network's legacy device explorer into the blockchain explorer. This will provide a visual view of the nodes that power the network, and will allow you to explore devices, what they contribute to the network and how much they earn on the back of completed jobs.

The explorer includes functionality to identify **named** and **trusted** wallets. These are wallets that are under the control of the network and the core team, and that are linked to the Community Wiki. Trusted wallets are identified with a green check mark within the explorer.
