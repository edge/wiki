# FAQ

## General

### What Does Edge Mean?

The Internet is made up of millions of discreet networks that are connected together. Devices within these network that are close to the end users of network services are described as being "at the edge". And that's where our name comes from.

### How Old Is the Edge Network?

We first released the Edge Network in 2018, but the technology has been in active R&D since 2013.

### Who Founded the Edge Network?

The Edge Network was originally concieved by Joseph Denne, Chris Mair and Will Lebens.

### How Many People Are in the Edge Team?

The core team is currently made up of 22 people. Edge is an all-remote company, and has been since the beginning. You can read about how we work here: [https://edge.network/en/culture](https://edge.network/en/culture)

### Is There an Edge Explorer?

There is! You can find it here: [explorer.edge.network](https://explorer.edge.network)

## Edge Nodes

{% page-ref page="../contributing-to-the-network/network-nodes.md" %}

### What Is an Edge Node?

An Edge Node is a computing device that's connected to the Edge Network in order to contribute its spare capacity. Edge nodes earn $XE coins in return for this, which can be used to buy services from the network. Alternatively, you can swap them for $EDGE tokens, which you can trade for other cryptocurrencies.

### Who Can Run an Edge Node?

Right now, the software for running an Edge Node is only available for Linux. However, we're working on versions for Windows, OSX and mobile devices at the moment.

### What Is a Stargate?

Stargates are Edge masternodes. They're responsible for the routing and security in the network, for monitoring resources and for controlling the payout contract.

### What Is a Gateway?

Gateways are Edge masternodes. They're responsible for connectivity in the network and act as the entry points for end user requests.

### What Is a Host?

Hosts are Edge Nodes responsible for the provision of computational power and storage within the network.

### Is Edge Proof of Work or Proof of Stake?

Edge operates a hybrid model of proof of stake and proof of work. We use proof of stake to secure the network; you need a stake to operate a node. We use proof of work to distribute yield. The size of this yield is based on the jobs that nodes successfully complete in the network.

## Technology

### What Blockchain Does Edge Use?

Edge has its own blockchain, developed end-to-end by the core team. It's called the Edge Ledger, and $XE runs on it.

### What Does Layer 2 Mean?

Layer 2 is a collective term for solutions designed to handle transactions off of the main Ethereum chain \(layer 1\). Transaction speed suffers when the network is busy, which slows down processing and also increases the cost of transactions.

$XE currently runs as a layer 2 solution, which enables fast and free transactions within the Edge Network, which are essential to the running of the technology.

### What Technology Is the Edge Network Built On?

The Edge Network is a completely unique technology stack, originated by the core team and developed over many years. It's predominantly written in Golang.

### Where Can I Find the Source Code for the Edge Network?

Edge's source code is partially open source, with plans for going fully open source in motion. You can access the project code repository on Github at: [github.com/edge](https://github.com/edge)

## Cryptocurrencies

### I held the original $EDGE, how do I get hold of $XE?

{% hint style="danger" %}
**The swap period for $EDGE closed on Thursday, 27th May 2021**
{% endhint %}

~~You should follow the swap process within Edge Console. You have until Thursday, 27th May 2021 to complete the swap. The swap closes after this period and you will not be able to swap further $EDGE.~~

Note that you can still use unswapped $EDGE to pay for network services.

### What Is the Difference Between $XE and $EDGE?

$XE is the internal coin of the Edge Network. We use it to attribute value to nodes, for staking and for network governance. It enables fast, free transactions.

$EDGE is a utility token on the Ethereum network. You can use it for trading and exchange.

You can convert $XE to $EDGE and vice versa using the Edge Network Bridge.

### What Is the Relationship Between $XE and $EDGE?

$XE and $EDGE are of equal value; a 1:1 relationship. That's because the coin and the token perform different functions in the network: 

- $XE is a layer 2 solution that facilitates fast and free transactions within the network
- $XE is bridged out to Ethereum, a process that converts the $XE to $EDGE

### Why Is the Network Coin Named XE?

The X comes from the ISO standard for currencies that aren't specific to a certain country. We use it because Edge sees its coin as the standard unit of account for edge computing. X-Edge, hence XE.

### When Claiming $XE, Can I Use a Single Wallet for Multiple Console Accounts?

Yep!

## Edge Products

### What's the relationship between Edge and Edit.com?

[Edit.com](https://edit.com) is a platform built by the core team that runs on the Edge Network. It's a content management platform that powers digital products, big and small. Every site or app running on Edit uses network services. It's in active development and has its own roadmap.

### Where Can I Sign Up for Edge CDN?

You can access Edge CDN via the [Edge Network website](https://edge.network) or by typing `cdn.new` into your browser.

### When Can I Get My Hands on Edge Object Storage?

Edge Object Storage is currently in active R&D. There's a proof of concept, which we're currently testing and evolving. We expect a beta release for community testing at some point in 2021, and a first production release sometime in 2022.

### When Can I Get My Hands on Edge Compute?

Edge Compute is in active testing with early partners. Compute services are aligned to Stargates in the network, which we'll make available on a Stargate–region basis. We expect a first production release in late 2021.

### Why Doesn’t Edge Have Feature X?

Edge's vision and roadmaps are extensive, while resource and time is limited. This means that the core team have to prioritise features and focus. The community can influence these decisions through network governance.

## Community
