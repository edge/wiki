## General

### What Does Edge Mean?

The name Edge refers to the edge of the network. The Internet is made up of millions of discreet networks that are connected together. Devices within these network that are close to the end users of network services are described as being "at the edge".

### How Old Is the Edge Network?

The Edge Network was first released in 2018, but the technology has been in actvie R&D since 2013.

### Who Founded the Edge Network?

The Edge Network was originally concieved by Joseph Denne, Chris Mair and Will Lebens.

### How Many People Are in the Edge Team?

The core team is currently comprised of 22 people. Edge is an all-remote company, and has been since inception. You can read about how we work here: [https://edge.network/en/culture](https://edge.network/en/culture)

### Is There an Edge Explorer?

Yes. You can access it here: [explorer.edge.network](https://explorer.edge.network)

## Edge Nodes

{% page-ref page="../contributing-to-the-network/network-nodes.md" %}

### What Is an Edge Node?

An Edge node is a computing device that is connected to the Edge Network in order to contribute its spare capacity. Edge nodes earn $XE coins in return for this, and these can be used to purchase services from the network, or they can be swapped for $EDGE tokens, which can be traded.

### Who Can Run an Edge Node?

At the moment the software for running an Edge node is only available for Linux. However versions are being made available for Windows, OSX and mobile devices.

### What Is a Stargate?

Stargates are Edge masternodes. They are responsible for the routing and security in the network, for monitoring resources and for controlling the payout contract.

### What Is a Gateway?

Gateways are Edge masternodes. They are responsible for connectivity in the network and act as the entry points for end user requests.

### What Is a Host?

Hosts are Edge nodes responsible for the provision of computational power and storage within the network.

### Is Edge Proof of Work or Proof of Stake?

Edge operates a hybrid model of proof of stake and proof of work. Proof of stake is used to help to secure the network, with a stake required to operate a node. Proof of work is used to distribute yield based on the jobs that nodes successfully complete in the network.

## Technology

### What Blockchain Does Edge Use?

Edge has its own blockchain, developed end-to-end by the core team. The chain is called the Edge Ledger, and it is this that $XE runs on.

### What Does Layer 2 Mean?

Layer 2 is a collective term for solutions designed to help scale your application by handling transactions off of the main Ethereum chain \(layer 1\). Transaction speed suffers when the network is busy, which slows down processing and also increases the cost of transactions.

$XE currently runs as a layer 2 solution, which enables fast and free transactions wihtin the Edge Network, which are essentual to the running of the technology.

### What Technology Is the Edge Network Built On?

The Edge Network is a completely unique technology stack, originated by the core team and developed over many years. It is predominantly written in Golang.

### Where Can I Find the Source Code for the Edge Network?

Edge's source code is currently partially open source, with plans for going fully open source in motion. You can access projects code repository on Github at: [github.com/edge](https://github.com/edge)

## Cryptocurrencies

### I held the original $EDGE, how do I get hold of $XE?

{% hint style="danger" %}
**The swap period for $EDGE closed on Thursday, 27th May 2021**
{% endhint %}

~~You should follow the swap process within Edge Console. You have until Thursday, 27th May 2021 to complete the swap. The swap closes after this period and you will not be able to swap further $EDGE.~~

Note that unswapped $EDGE can still be used for the payment of network services.



### What Is the Difference Between $XE and $EDGE?

$XE is the internal coin of the Edge Network. It is used for attribution of value to nodes, for staking and for network governance. It provides for fast, free transactions.

$EDGE is a utility token on the Ethereum network. It is available for trading and exchange.

You can convert $XE to $EDGE and vice versa using the Edge Network Bridge.

### What Is the Relationship Between $XE and $EDGE?

$XE and $EDGE are of equal value. The 1:1 relationship is because the coin and the token perform different functions in the network, with $XE as a layer 2 solution designed to facilitate fast and free transactions wihtin the network. $XE is bridged out to Ethereum, a process that converts the $XE to $EDGE.

### Why Is the Network Coin Named XE?

The X is from the ISO standard for currencies that are not specific to a certain country. It has been used because Edge sees it's coin as the standard unit of account for edge computing. X-Edge, hence XE.

### When Claiming $XE, Can I Use a Single Wallet for Multiple Console Accounts?

Yes.

## Edge Products

### What's the relationship between Edge and Edit.com?

[Edit.com](https://edit.com) is a platform built by the core team that runs on the Edge Network. It is a content management platform that powers digital products big and small. Every site or app running on Edit uses network services. Edit is in active development and has its own roadmap.

### Where Can I Sign Up for Edge CDN?

Edge CDN can be accessed via the [Edge Network website](https://edge.network) or by typing `cdn.new` into your browser.

### When Can I Get My Hands on Edge Object Storage?

Edge Object Storage is currently in active R&D. A proof of concept exists and is currently being tested and evolved. A beta release is expected to be reelased for community testing at some point in 2021, with a first production release expected in 2022.

### When Can I Get My Hands on Edge Compute?

Edge Compute is in active testing with early partners. Compute services are aligned to Stargates in the network, and will be made available on a Stargate–region basis. First production release is expected in late 2021.

### Why Doesn’t Edge Have Feature X?

Edge's vision and roadmaps are extensive, while resource and time is limited. This means that the core team have to prioritise features and focus. These decisions can be influenced by the community through network governance.
