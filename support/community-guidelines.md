# Community Guidelines

Edge is commited to providing a supportive and friendly community. That's why there are a few community guidelines that we ask everyone to follow.

They are:

1. **Be Nice** - The Golden Rule! Treat others as you want to be treated.
2. **Be Open to Debate** – Everyone has the right to hold views that are different to your own.
3. **No ‘FUD’** - Spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt, which includes general misinformation, lies and toxicity, will not be tolerated. Our moderation team can spot the difference between constructive discussion and FUD.
4. **Don't Spam or Shill** - If it's not related to Edge, it has no place in this community. Self-promotion, shilling and advertising is not allowed unless it relates to Edge in a specific way. Referral links are not tolerated in public channels or unsolicited PMs.
5. **No Illegal Activities** - The buying/selling of drugs, pyramid schemes, tax evasion, hacking and any other illegal activity is not allowed.
6. **No Trade Talk** - Community members discussing price and market related topics, with the exception of news relating to exchange listings, will be invited to continue their conversations elsewhere. This includes over-the-counter trading.
7. **No Inappropriate Names** - Community members with nicknames that are inappropriate or that otherwise break these rules will be asked to change them. Repeatedly breaking this rule will result in a ban.
