### What's the Difference Between $XE and $EDGE?

$XE is the Edge Network's internal coin. You can use it to attribute value to nodes, for staking and for network governance. It enables fast, free transactions.

$EDGE is a utility token on the Ethereum network. It's available to trade and exchange.

You can convert $XE to $EDGE and vice versa using the Edge Network Bridge.

### What Is the Relationship Between $XE and $EDGE?

$XE and $EDGE are of equal value; a 1:1 relationship. This is necessary because the coin and the token perform different functions in the network, namely: 

- $XE as a layer 2 solution designed to facilitate fast and free transactions wihtin the network 
- $XE is bridged out to Ethereum, a process that converts the $XE to $EDGE

### Why Is the Network Coin Called XE?

The X comes from the ISO standard for currencies that are not specific to a certain country. We use it because Edge sees its coin as the standard unit of account for edge computing. X-Edge, hence XE.

### Why is my withdrawal taking so long?

If the transaction speed fee you provided is lower than current gas costs, the bridge will wait until gas fees are low enough to process the transaction within the threshold you set. In this circumstance the time depends on the costs in the Ethereum network.

### How are Gas Fees Paid in the Network Bridge?

When you withdraw $XE through the Bridge, you pay gas in XE. When you deposit $EDGE to the Network, you pay gas in Eth via your Metamask wallet.

### Why Is the Holder Number Shown in DEXTools So Low?

$XE is a layer 2 blockchain that bridges between chains. This means that there are more $XE holders in the network than there are $EDGE holders outside of the network. The ratio is currently around 5x the number shown in DEXTools and other Ethereum explorers.
