### What Is an Edge Node?

An Edge node is a computing device that's connected to the Edge Network. It contributes its spare capacity. In return, Edge nodes earn $XE coins, which you can use to buy services from the network. ALternatively, you can swap them for $EDGE tokens, which you can trade for other cryptocurrencies.

### Who Can Run an Edge Node?

At the moment, the software for running an Edge node is only available for Linux. However, we're working on versions for Windows, OSX and mobile devices too.

### What Is a Stargate?

Stargates are Edge masternodes. They're responsible for the network's routing and security, for monitoring resources and for controlling the payout contract.

### What Is a Gateway?

Gateways are Edge masternodes. They're responsible for network connectivity. They also act as entry points for end user requests.

### What Is a Host?

Hosts are Edge nodes. They provide the network's computational power.

### Is Edge Proof of Work or Proof of Stake?

Edge uses a hybrid model of proof of stake and proof of work. It uses proof of stake to help keep the network secure, with a stake required to operate a node. It uses proof of work to distribute yield based on the jobs that nodes successfully complete in the network.
