### What's the Difference Between $XE and $EDGE?

$XE is the internal coin of the Edge Network. We use it to attribute value to nodes, for staking and to govern the network. It facilitates fast, free transactions.

$EDGE is a utility token on the Ethereum network. It's available for trading and exchange.

You can convert $XE to $EDGE and vice versa using the Edge Network Bridge.

### What Is the Relationship Between $XE and $EDGE?

$XE and $EDGE are of equal value; a 1:1 relationship. This is necessary because the coin and the token do different things in the network, namely: 

- $XE is a layer 2 solution designed to facilitate fast and free transactions within the network 
- $XE is bridged out to Ethereum, a process that converts the $XE to $EDGE

### Why Is the Network Coin Named XE?

The X comes from the ISO standard for currencies that are not specific to a certain country. We see our coin as the standard unit of account for edge computing. X-Edge, hence XE.
