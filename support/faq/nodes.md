### What Is an Edge Node?

An Edge node is a computing device that's connected to the Edge Network. They contribute their spare capacity. In return, Edge nodes earn $XE coins, which you can use to buy services from the network. Alternatively, you can swap them for $EDGE tokens, which you can trade for other cryptocurrencies.

### Who Can Run an Edge Node?

At the moment, the software for running an Edge node is only available for Linux. However, versions are being made available for Windows, OSX and mobile devices too.

### What Is a Stargate?

Stargates are Edge masternodes. They're responsible for the network's routing and security, for monitoring resources and for controlling the payout contract.

### What Is a Gateway?

Gateways are Edge masternodes. They're responsible for network connectivity and act as entry points for end user requests.

### What Is a Host?

Hosts are Edge nodes. They're responsible for computational power and storage within the network.

### Is Edge Proof of Work or Proof of Stake?

Edge operates a hybrid model of proof of stake and proof of work. We use proof of stake to secure the network, with a stake required to operate a node. We use proof of work to distribute yield based on the network jobs that nodes successfully complete.
