# Other Issues

The best channel to get help outside of this wiki is in the \#support chat on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/edgenetwork). Community Manager, members of the core team and other helpful members of the community are able to assist with any issue you may run into.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**WARNING:** Do **NOT** accept help from somebody private messaging you claiming to be a member of the core team or a Community manager! This is a common scam technique designed to talk you into giving up information that can allow bad actors to steal your funds. **NEVER** give out wallet seed phrases! There is absolutely no reason for any member of the team to request this information.

If a team member sees a need to continue support in private, they will publicly ask **YOU** to message them first.
