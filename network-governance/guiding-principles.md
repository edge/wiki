# Guiding Principles

Governance in the Edge Network is designed to be:

1. **Participatory**. A community that takes part is key to the network's success. This informs and organises our governance, and makes Edge a better place to be.
2. **Consensus Oriented**. There'll be multiple points of view for each aspect of the network. The governance mechanism is designed to facilitate healthy and open debate.
3. **Accountable**. The core team must follow up on all proposals raised through the governance mechanism.
4. **Transparent**. Information must be freely available and directly accessible to those who will be affected by the proposals raised through governance.
5. **Responsive**. The core team should respond to proposals within a reasonable timeframe.
6. **Effective and Efficient**. The governance approach should produce results that balances the needs of stakeholders whilst making the best use of the resources at hand.
7. **Equitable and Inclusive**. There should be no barriers to community involvement in governance.

## Guidelines for the Core Team

The core team must abide by these guiding principles in relation to project governance, and publish proposals for any change to the network that materially impacts:

1. The tokenomics of the network
2. The community's involvement in network governance
3. The community's ability to contribute capacity to the network
4. The operation of the network as a services layer for Web3
5. Live or planned services on top of the network

Furthermore, no movement in the $XE held within the growth fund may be made without a proposal being raised and passed by the community.
