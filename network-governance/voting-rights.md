# Voting Rights

Anyone with an active $XE stake can participate in governance. This includes all node operators.

One stake in the network provides one vote on each governance proposal. In addition, if you hold a Stargate, you have a  collective right to veto, and to propose amendments to proposals that can be sent back to the entire community for a further vote.
