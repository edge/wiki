# An Introduction to Governance

The governance functions of the Edge Network are open for anyone with an active $XE stake. Node operators too.

**Governance is not yet live. It is expected to launch summer 2021**
{% endhint %}

Stakeholders have the ability to create and vote upon proposals. Creating proposals sosts $XE and voting on them locks stakes for a fixed period of time. These measures are designed to keep the quality of proposals high.

Proposals will require certain majorities in order to be passed. Stargates have a collective right to veto or to propose amendments to proposals.

**Governance is currently advisory, with the core dev team also holding the right to veto**

## Growth Fund

The network's growth fund is a meaningful and growing allocation of $XE, set aside to make the network better. As a community, we may decide to put it towards things like marketing, exchange listings and community rewards. Network governance decides how we'll collectively use the growth fund.
