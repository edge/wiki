  Edge is a peer-to-peer network that doesn’t rely on servers. 
  It’s powered by blockchain technology and built using the spare capacity all around us.

# A Brief History

Our Founders built Edge in 2013 as a decentralised alternative to the cloud. Originally called DADI — or "Decentralised Architecture for a Democratic Internet" — we renamed the company Edge in July 2019 to better reflect the evolution of the technology and its mission.

Edge held a crowdsale in 2018 to raise funds for the delivery of the core network. This crowdsale distributed $EDGE tokens to supporters and future customers over the course of a five-year roadmap.

We launched Edge's testnet &mdash; which runs on test.network &mdash; in January 2018, with the first release of the mainnet soon after in May 2018. The first products built on top of the Edge Network were [DNS](https://edge.network/en/dns) and [Content Delivery](https://edge.network/cdn), both of which are live and in production today.

In 2019, the Future Digital Awards recognised Edge as the “Best Edge Computing Platform”. Good news travels fast.

Two years later, we extended our blockchain to become a mechanism for value transfer. This allowed us to introduce $XE, a coin used for value attribution within the network. $XE continues to operate as a layer 2 solution for Ethereum, and the Edge community uses it for all sorts of things:

- Payment of services; 
- Network staking; 
- Distribution of node yields; 
- Community governance

$XE is bridged to the $EDGE ERC-20 token within the Etheruem network.

Our project roadmaps capture the near- to mid-term development priorities. Typically, we're focused on the core network layer, as well as individual services on top of the network \(such as Object Storage, Edge Functions and Edge DB\).

## Mission & Vision

### To Uphold the Founding Principles of the Web

The Internet was conceived as a global, democratic communication network &mdash; a mesh of computers where information and power were equally distributed. This principle is under attack from all sides. Companies like _Google_, _Amazon_ and _Microsoft_ are centralising control, while powerful lobbying groups are working to undermine net neutrality. We're facing a future where you are the customer &mdash; and the product &mdash; of a network controlled by only a handful of global corporations.

We want to reverse this relationship &mdash; to give ownership of the network to everyone that's connected to it, and to make them the beneficiaries of the revenue that comes from its use.

### The Edge Network as the Standard for the Decentralised Web \(Web 3.0\)

A network of millions of nodes, directly addressable and usable by anyone. A governance system free from individual or multinational control, organised by a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation.
