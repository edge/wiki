# Project Roadmaps

The project roadmap for Edge provides a guide to the platform's current and upcoming development focus. We maintain the roadmap at a high level, and it is deliberately low resolution. Individual work streams have their own development schedules and lists, which are maintained in Git.

**The roadmap is updated regularly as priorities change and new requirements are confirmed**

## Rolling Priorities

Alongside specific technical milestones, there are high-level project goals that the core team are working towards. These include: 

- Moving the project to a full open source footing; 
- Moving to full decentralisation in all areas of the network stack; 
- Preferencing anonymity and privacy; 
- Deeply embedding community governance throughout the project's organisational structures

The nature of these tasks is such that it isn't possible to schedule them as finite deliveries. Rather, they're understood by the entire team as objectives, and we're consistently working towards them.
