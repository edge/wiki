# Content Delivery

{% embed url="https://vimeo.com/528575049" caption="" %}

Edge’s architecture creates a hyper-local peering system that routes traffic from nodes that are as close to the end consumer as possible.

This reduces the distance and volume of data being moved, which massively increases the performance of services.

## Features

### **Hyper local**

Edge CDN has hundreds of nodes in over 80 countries, getting your content closer to your audience than ever before.

### **Integrated Image Transformation**

Edge Content Delivery includes a media pipeline that allows for just-in-time image manipulation: Blur, filter, flip, format, resize, rotate, saturate, sharpen and crop. This offsets the weight of media management to your delivery solution.

### **Real Time Optimisation**

Real time compression and resizing of assets at the point of request saves an average of 60% in filesize, speeding up delivery, reducing your overall costs, and increasing conversion.

### **End to End TLS**

Take workload off your origin by serving SSL certificates directly at the edge, accelerating performance and increasing availability.

### **Cost Effective**

Edge CDN saves 20%+ on average vs. traditional CDNs as a result of better media compression and the use of edge devices instead of centralised data centres.

## Sign Up & Documentation

You can launch a new instance of Edge CDN here: [cdn.new](https://cdn.new)

Documentation can be found here: [edge.network/en/content-delivery/documentation](https://edge.network/en/content-delivery/documentation/)

## IRL

Edge content delivery can be seen running on [Monocle.com](https://monocle.com), where it handles all media and asset delivery.

Checking the headers from an image call returns the cache state for the asset in the network, as well as the device IDs of the nodes involved in its delivery.
