# Edge Products

There are two products live in the network mainnet today, DNS and CDN. Many more products are in development, including Edge Storage, App Cache, Edge Functions and Edge DB.

Together these products allow you to create and run fully decentralised applications and websites.

## Edge Product Use Cases

### Hosting

{% hint style="info" %}
**Static websites can be run in the network today, delivered through CDN**
{% endhint %}

An example of a static site hosted via Edge Content Delviery can be seen here: [thedecentralizedweb.com](https://thedecentralizedweb.com)

Dynamic sites will be enabled with the addition of Edge Cache, Edge Functions and Edge DB.

Hosting on the Edge ensures a lightening fast experience for your end users, increasing conversion and retention.

### Content Delivery

The performance of applications and websites can be improved through the use of CDN, which distributes images, media and assets as close to the end audience as possible.

Edge CDN includes a full media pipeline, enabling you to transform, optimise and intelligently cache your  media library using simple and robust URL parameters.

Edge CDN can be used a drop in replacement for existing CDNs, and can be added to websites and apps without a CDN in place quickly and easily.

### Domain Routing

DNS is a critical part of the Internet and for all online businesses. Edge enables the management of DNS routes, providing an authoritative DNS service that offers instant updates, hyper-local routing, high redundancy, and advanced security with built-in DDoS mitigation.

### File Storage and Sharing

Edge Object Storage enables fully decentralised, high performance and secure file storage, backup and file sharing for individuals and businesses. Files stored in the Edge Network can be encrypted with your own private keys, and are broken in to hundreds of pieces, providing an extremely secure data storage solution.

### Application Acceleration

Caching API endpoints at the edge of the network accelerates your products responsiveness, improving user experience, helping to drive deeper engagement and higher conversion.

## Customer Success

Edge technology is in production use today, powering some of the best digital experiences online.

### Monocle

Monocle use Edge CDN for the management of images and audio across their estate, including on their website at monocle.com, in their mobile app M24 and, via a sync-up with InDesign, in the publication itself.

High resolution source images are scaled and intelligently cropped by Edge CDN, significantly reducing the weight of work for their editorial teams.
