The use of these funds is under the control of the core team, with guidance regarding focus provided through project governance.

The dev fund is designed to be used for core development. This includes developer remuneration, hardware and software costs, securing IP rights and any other directly associated overheads.

The dev fund is funded by a buy back and make programme, with network revenues converted to $XE and transferred to the fund.
