  There are two methods of value exchange in the Edge Network: $XE, which is
  internal to the network, and $EDGE, which is on the public Ethereum network.

# Edge Tokenomics

$XE is a layer 2 solution designed for fast transactions mapped to resource usage. It's bridged into the Ethereum network on a 1:1 basis with the $EDGE token.

Transactions within the Edge Network are free for staking wallets. Non-staking wallets are charged a small fee to help to maintain the security of the chain. Bridging $XE in/out of the network to $EDGE in the Ethereum network carries a variable gas fee.

For transactions out of Edge Network, a fee is taken in $XE. You can choose your target gas fees and the bridge will automatically transmit your transaction to meet it. This helps to keep transaction fees as low as possible.

For transactions into the Edge Network, the gas fee is taken in $ETH.

As a network native coin, $XE does not count towards the circulating supply of $EDGE. Therefore service usage, staking, governance and fees all act to reduce the circulating supply of $EDGE by locking value in the network itself.

## $EDGE

$EDGE is a tradable utility token on the Ethereum network (ERC-20). It's the entry point to the Edge ecosystem, and you can use it to purchase Edge services.

You can bridge $EDGE tokens into the Edge network and convert them to $XE using the Edge Bridge. $EDGE and $XE have a 1:1 relationship, which means that for every 1 $EDGE bridged into the network, you'll get 1 $XE.

When you purchase a service in $EDGE, the $EDGE is automatically bridged into the network, reducing circulating supply.

### Service Purchase

In addition to being purchaseable with $EDGE, you can also pay for Edge services using Visa and MasterCard networks. If you'd prefer to be invoiced directly, you can do so by reaching out on: [sales@edge.network](mailto:%20sales@edge.network)

Purchases made in fiat (Visa/MasterCard) or in other cryptocurrencies are swapped for $EDGE before being bridged into Edge Network, which converts them to $XE.

### Liquidity Mining

You'll find an $EDGE liquidity pool on Uniswap, which was initially funded by the network treasury.

Uniswap applies a 0.30% fee for every trade that takes place on their platform, and automatically sends this to a liquidity reserve. Whenever a liquidity provider decides they want to exit the $EDGE pool, they'll receive a portion of the total fees from the reserve relative to their staked amount in $EDGE the pool.

In addition to this, a 0.75% fee is applied to all $XE transactions that move through the network bridge. This amount is automatically deducted from the sent amount and is collected in an $XE vault wallet ([xe\_4845075Ad790DD979Ab3f7834Ff507244e7a5449](https://xe.network/wallet/xe\_4845075Ad790DD979Ab3f7834Ff507244e7a5449)). These funds are periodically bridged out of the network and redistributed as LP rewards to those providing liquidity for $EDGE on Uniswap.

## $XE

$XE is a layer 2 solution designed for fast transactions mapped to resource usage. It's bridged into the Ethereum network on a 1:1 basis with the $EDGE token, meaning that for every 1 $XE bridged out of the Edge Network, you will receive 1 $EDGE.

You can use $XE to buy Edge services, for staking, network governance, and for node rewards.

### Transactions

Transactions within the Edge Network are free for staking wallets. Non-staking wallets are charged a small fee to help to maintain the security of the chain (mitigating against flood attacks). These fees are assigned equally to the dev fund and to the growth fund.

### Service Purchase

If you buy a servcice using $XE directly, you'll get a service discount of 10% â€” as a reward for holding and using $XE.

### Node Staking

Edge is a Proof of Stake network. Contributing a node to the network requires a POS in $XE. Stakes are locked in the network for a minimum period of time and as long as the node is online.

Nodes that are found to be bad actors will have their stake penalised or removed. If the network reclaims a stake like this, it's burned (sent to a zero address in the XE chain).

### Network Governance

If you want to participate in network governance, you'll need a stake locked in the network in $XE. This can be a stake used for the contribution of a node or an unassigned stake used purely for governance participation.

Fees tied to the raising of proposals in the governance mechanism are put into the growth fund.

### Buy Back and Make

A buy back and make programme assigns network revenue to the dev fund and to the growth fund. A percent of the gas fees from the network bridge are put into the growth fund as well.
