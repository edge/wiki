## Node Rewards

$XE has a mineable supply of 10 million coins, with a steady emissions curve tied to block time. Mined coins provide the yield for the network and are released as node rewards.

The maximum yield in year one is 1 million $XE (10%). This will be reduced in year two, further in year three and so on.

The following table shows  emitted $XE from genesis and for the next five years:
