  The Bridge is a vital component of the Edge ecosystem, enabling seamless
  interoperability between the Edge's native blockchain—which uses the XE
  token—and external blockchain networks like Ethereum.

# Network Bridge

The bridge currently operates two hot wallets, one for the $XE side and one for the $EDGE side in the Ethereum network.

The bridge wallet in $XE can be found here:

<table><thead><tr><th width="752">$XE Wallet Address</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://xe.network/wallet/xe_ed9e52B9d1426D546d239befbb4FDdabC9aFa006">xe_ed9e52B9d1426D546d239befbb4FDdabC9aFa006</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

The bridge wallet on Ethereum for cross-chain asset transfers can be founde here:

<table><thead><tr><th width="752">$EDGE Wallet Address</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x4ec1b60b96193a64acae44778e51f7bff2007831?a=0x9560f507e34d375b6593d551bb2c10d48884c787">0x9560F507E34d375B6593D551bb2C10D48884c787</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

The $EDGE wallet address is funded by the network deployer.

## AML Requirements

The  bridge is run by Edge Network Technologies, the not for profit that maintains the Edge project and that is registered in the United Kingdom. Large transactions through the bridge may be subject to AML checks, depending on the histories of the wallets involved and their status within the network.

This verification process is specific to bridge operations and is triggered by the transaction value, not the token count. We aim to make this process as smooth as possible while meeting our regulatory obligations.

_Note that if a third party was operating a bridge for XE in a different jurisdiction, or as an open source offering, it would not necessarily be subject to these rules._
