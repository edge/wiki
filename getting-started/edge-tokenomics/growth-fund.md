The use of these funds is under the control of project governance, meaning that community members can raise proposals for its use, and vote on proposals raised.

The growth fund is designed to be used for activities outside of core development. This includes exchange listings, marketing, third party integrations, partnerships and community engagement.

The growth fund is initially funded through a dilution applied to all current $EDGE holdings. A buy back and make programme assigns a percent of network revenues to the growth fund. In addition to this, a  percent of the gas fees from the network bridge are put into the growth fund.
